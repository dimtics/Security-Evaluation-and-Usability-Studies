abstract = {OUTLAST Temperature Regulating Fabrics, from Gateway Technologies Inc, use phase change materials in a cyclic process to absorb, store and release heat to maintain a comfortable temperature equilibrium within the microclimate between an insulating fabric and the skin. Outlast fabrics also minimise overheating, and are unaffected by moisture or compression like traditional lofted insulation products. The technology behind the micro-encapsulated phase change materials (microPCMs) is described, as well as the changes necessary in the thermal testing of OUTLAST fabrics which differ from the traditional lofted insulation.$\backslash$nOutlast Temperature Regulating Fabrics are revolutionazing traditional notions and applications of thermal insulation. By leveraging the inevitable heat output from the human body, OUTLAST Fibers {\&} Fabrics create a dynamic, temperature-regulated environment.

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

@article{Bonneau2015,
abstract = {—Bitcoin has emerged as the most successful crypto-graphic currency in history. Within two years of its quiet launch in 2009, Bitcoin grew to comprise billions of dollars of economic value despite only cursory analysis of the system's design. Since then a growing literature has identified hidden-but-important properties of the system, discovered attacks, proposed promis-ing alternatives, and singled out difficult future challenges. Meanwhile a large and vibrant open-source community has proposed and deployed numerous modifications and extensions. We provide the first systematic exposition Bitcoin and the many related cryptocurrencies or 'altcoins.' Drawing from a scattered body of knowledge, we identify three key components of Bitcoin's design that can be decoupled. This enables a more insightful analysis of Bitcoin's properties and future stability. We map the design space for numerous proposed modifica-tions, providing comparative analyses for alternative consensus mechanisms, currency allocation mechanisms, computational puzzles, and key management tools. We survey anonymity issues in Bitcoin and provide an evaluation framework for analyzing a variety of privacy-enhancing proposals. Finally we provide new insights on what we term disintermediation protocols, which absolve the need for trusted intermediaries in an interesting set of applications. We identify three general disintermediation strategies and provide a detailed comparison. I. WHY BITCOIN IS WORTHY OF RESEARCH Consider two opposing viewpoints on Bitcoin in straw-man form. The first is that " Bitcoin works in practice, but not in theory. " At times devoted members of the Bitcoin community espouse this philosophy and criticize the security research community for failing to discover Bitcoin, not im-mediately recognizing its novelty, and still today dismissing it due to the lack of a rigorous theoretical foundation. A second viewpoint is that Bitcoin's stability relies on an unknown combination of socioeconomic factors which is hopelessly intractable to model with sufficient precision, failing to yield a convincing argument for the system's soundness. Given these difficulties, experienced security re-searchers may avoid Bitcoin as a topic of study, considering it prudent security engineering to only design systems with precise threat models that admit formal security proofs. We intend to show where each of these simplistic view-points fail. To the first, we contend that while Bitcoin has worked surprisingly well in practice so far, there is an im-portant role for research to play in identifying precisely why this has been possible, moving beyond a blind acceptance of the informal arguments presented with the system's initial proposal. Furthermore, it is crucial to understand whether Bitcoin will still " work in practice " as practices change. We expect external political and economic factors to evolve, the system must change if and when transaction volume scales, and the nature of the monetary rewards for Bitcoin miners will change over time as part of the system design. It is not enough to argue that Bitcoin has worked from 2009– 2014 and will therefore continue likewise. We do not yet have sufficient understanding to conclude with confidence that Bitcoin will continue to work well in practice, which is a crucial research challenge that requires insight from computer science theory. To the second viewpoint, we contend that Bitcoin is filling an important niche by providing a virtual currency system without any trusted parties and without pre-assumed identities among the participants. Within these constraints, the general problem of consensus in a distributed system is impossible [7], [93] without further assumptions like Bitcoin's premise that rational (greedy) behavior can be modeled and incentives can be aligned to ensure secure operation of the consensus algorithm. Yet these constraints matter in practice, both philosophically and technically, and Bitcoin's approach to consensus within this model is deeply surprising and a fundamental contribution. Bitcoin's core consensus protocol also has profound implications for many other computer security problems beyond currency 1 such as distributed naming, secure timestamping and commitment, generation of public randomness, as well as many finan-cial problems such as self-enforcing (" smart ") contracts, decentralized markets and order books, and distributed au-tonomous agents. In short, even though Bitcoin is not easy to model, it is worthy of considerable research attention as it may form the basis for practical solutions to exceedingly difficult and important problems. With this dichotomy in mind, we set out to synthesize the collective knowledge from the first six years of Bitcoin's operation and development, as well as from its many derived cryptocurrencies. Our goal is both to highlight the many areas where significant innovation has already occurred, ranging from novel payment protocols to user-friendly key management, and also highlight the most important open research challenges for Bitcoin and future cryptocurrencies.},

abstract = {Managing Risk and Information Security: Protect to Enable, an ApressOpen title, describes the changing risk environment and why a fresh approach to information security is needed. Because almost every aspect of an enterprise is now dependent on technology, the focus of IT security must shift from locking down assets to enabling the business while managing and surviving risk. This compact book discusses business risk from a broader perspective, including privacy and regulatory considerations. It describes the increasing number of threats and vulnerabilities, but also offers strategies for developing solutions. These include discussions of how enterprises can take advantage of new and emerging technologies-such as social media and the huge proliferation of Internet-enabled devices-while minimizing risk. With ApressOpen, content is freely available through multiple online distribution channels and electronic formats with the goal of disseminating professionally edited and technically reviewed content to the worldwide community. Here are some of the responses from reviewers of this exceptional work: "Managing Risk and Information Security is a perceptive, balanced, and often thought-provoking exploration of evolving information risk and security challenges within a business context. Harkins clearly connects the needed, but often-overlooked linkage and dialog between the business and technical worlds and offers actionable strategies. The book contains eye-opening security insights that are easily understood, even by the curious layman." Fred Wettling, Bechtel Fellow, IS{\&}T Ethics {\&} Compliance Officer, Bechtel "As disruptive technology innovations and escalating cyber threats continue to create enormous information security challenges, Managing Risk and Information Security: Protect to Enable provides a much-needed perspective. This book compels information security professionals to think differently about concepts of risk management in order to be more effective. The specific and practical guidance offers a fast-track formula for developing information security strategies which are lock-step with business priorities." Laura Robinson, Principal, Robinson Insight Chair, Security for Business Innovation Council (SBIC) Program Director, Executive Security Action Forum (ESAF) "The mandate of the information security function is being completely rewritten. Unfortunately most heads of security haven't picked up on the change, impeding their companies' agility and ability to innovate. This book makes the case for why security needs to change, and shows how to get started. It will be regarded as marking the turning point in information security for years to come." Dr. Jeremy Bergsman, Practice Manager, CEB "The world we are responsible to protect is changing dramatically and at an accelerating pace. Technology is pervasive in virtually every aspect of our lives. Clouds, virtualization and mobile are redefining computing - and they are just the beginning of what is to come. Your security perimeter is defined by wherever your information and people happen to be. We are attacked by professional adversaries who are better funded than we will ever be. We in the information security profession must change as dramatically as the environment we protect. We need new skills and new strategies to do our jobs effectively. We literally need to change the way we think. Written by one of the best in the business, Managing Risk and Information Security challenges traditional security theory with clear examples of the need for change. It also provides expert advice on how to dramatically increase the success of your security strategy and methods - from dealing with the misperception of risk to how to become a Z-shaped CISO. Managing Risk and Information Security is the ultimate treatise on how to deliver effective security to the world we live in for the next 10 years. It is absolute must reading for anyone in our profession - and should be on the desk of every CISO in the world." Dave Cullinane, CISSP CEO Security Starfish, LLC "In this overview, Malcolm Harkins delivers an insightful survey of the trends, threats, and tactics shaping information risk and security. From regulatory compliance to psychology to the changing threat context, this work provides a compelling introduction to an important topic and trains helpful attention on the effects of changing technology and management practices." Dr. Mariano-Florentino Cu{\'{e}}llar Professor, Stanford Law School Co-Director, Stanford Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC), Stanford University "Malcolm Harkins gets it. In his new book Malcolm outlines the major forces changing the information security risk landscape from a big picture perspective, and then goes on to offer effective methods of managing that risk from a practitioner's viewpoint. The combination makes this book unique and a must read for anyone interested in IT risk." Dennis Devlin AVP, Information Security and Compliance, The George Washington University "Managing Risk and Information Security is the first-to-read, must-read book on information security for C-Suite executives. It is accessible, understandable and actionable. No sky-is-falling scare tactics, no techno-babble - just straight talk about a critically important subject. There is no better primer on the economics, ergonomics and psycho-behaviourals of security than this." Thornton May, Futurist, Executive Director {\&} Dean, IT Leadership Academy "Managing Risk and Information Security is a wake-up call for information security executives and a ray of light for business leaders. It equips organizations with the knowledge required to transform their security programs from a "culture of no" to one focused on agility, value and competitiveness. Unlike other publications, Malcolm provides clear and immediately applicable solutions to optimally balance the frequently opposing needs of risk reduction and business growth. This book should be required reading for anyone currently serving in, or seeking to achieve, the role of Chief Information Security Officer." Jamil Farshchi, Senior Business Leader of Strategic Planning and Initiatives, VISA "For too many years, business and security - either real or imagined - were at odds. In Managing Risk and Information Security: Protect to Enable, you get what you expect - real life practical ways to break logjams, have security actually enable business, and marries security architecture and business architecture. Why this book? It's written by a practitioner, and not just any practitioner, one of the leading minds in Security today." John Stewart, Chief Security Officer, Cisco "This book is an invaluable guide to help security professionals address risk in new ways in this alarmingly fast changing environment. Packed with examples which makes it a pleasure to read, the book captures practical ways a forward thinking CISO can turn information security into a competitive advantage for their business. This book provides a new framework for managing risk in an entertaining and thought provoking way. This will change the way security professionals work with their business leaders, and help get products to market faster. The 6 irrefutable laws of information security should be on a stone plaque on the desk of every security professional." Steven Proctor, VP, Audit {\&} Risk Management, Flextronics},

@article{Faraway2002,
abstract = {There are many books on regression and analysis of variance. These books expect different levels of preparedness and place different emphases on the material. This book is not introductory. It presumes some knowledge of basic statistical theory and practice. Students are expected to know the essentials of statistical inference like estimation, hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. A basic knowledge of data analysis is presumed. Some linear algebra and calculus is also required. The emphasis of this text is on the practice of regression and analysis of variance. The objective is to learn what methods are available and more importantly, when they should be applied. Many examples are presented to clarify the use of the techniques and to demonstrate what conclusions can be made. There is relatively less emphasis on mathematical theory, partly because some prior knowledge is assumed and partly because the issues are better tackled elsewhere. Theory is important because it guides the approach we take. I take a wider view of statistical theory. It is not just the formal theorems. Qualitative statistical concepts are just as important in Statistics because these enable us to actually do it rather than just talk about it. These qualitative principles are harder to learn because they are difficult to state precisely but they guide the successful experienced Statistician. Data analysis cannot be learnt without actually doing it. This means using a statistical computing package. There is a wide choice of such packages. They are designed for different audiences and have different strengths and weaknesses. I have chosen to use R (ref. Ihaka and Gentleman (1996)). Why do I use R The are several reasons. 1. Versatility. R is a also a programming language, so I am not limited by the procedures that are preprogrammed by a package. It is relatively easy to program new methods in R . 2. Interactivity. Data analysis is inherently interactive. Some older statistical packages were designed when computing was more expensive and batch processing of computations was the norm. Despite improvements in hardware, the old batch processing paradigm lives on in their use. R does one thing at a time, allowing us to make changes on the basis of what we see during the analysis. 3. R is based on S from which the commercial package S-plus is derived. R itself is open-source software and may be freely redistributed. Linux, Macintosh, Windows and other UNIX versions are maintained and can be obtained from the R-project at www.r-project.org. R is mostly compatible with S-plus meaning that S-plus could easily be used for the examples given in this book. 4. Popularity. SAS is the most common statistics package in general but R or S is most popular with researchers in Statistics. A look at common Statistical journals confirms this popularity. R is also popular for quantitative applications in Finance. The greatest disadvantage of R is that it is not so easy to learn. Some investment of effort is required before productivity gains will be realized. This book is not an introduction to R. There is a short introduction in the Appendix but readers are referred to the R-project web site at www.r-project.org where you can find introductory documentation and information about books on R . I have intentionally included in the text all the commands used to produce the output seen in this book. This means that you can reproduce these analyses and experiment with changes and variations before fully understanding R . The reader may choose to start working through this text before learning R and pick it up as you go. The web site for this book is at where data de- scribed in this book appears. Updates will appear there also. Thanks to the builders of R without whom this book would not have been possible.},

@book{Cichosz2015,
abstract = {Data mining has been a rapidly growing field of research and practical applications during the last two decades. From a somewhat niche academic area at the intersection ofmachine learning and statistics it has developed into an established scientific discipline and a highly valued branch of the computing industry. This is reflected by datamining becoming an essential part of computer science education as well as the increasing overall awareness of the term “data mining” among the general (not just computing-related) academic and business audience. Various definitions of data mining may be found in the literature. Some of them are broad enough to include all types of data analysis, regardless of the representation and applicability of their results. This book narrows down the scope of data mining by adopting a heavily modeling-oriented perspective. According to this perspective the ultimate goal of datamining is delivering predictive models. The latter can be thought of as computationally represented chunks of knowledge about some domain of interest, described by the analyzed data, that are capable of providing answers to queries transcending the data, i.e., such that cannot be answered by just extracting and aggregating values from the data. Such knowledge is discov- ered from data by capturing and generalizing useful relationship patterns that occur therein. Activities needed for creating predictive models based on data and making sure that they meet the application's requirements fall in the scope of data mining as understood in this book. Analytical activities which do not contribute to model creation – although they may still deliver extremely useful results – remain therefore beyond the scope of our interest. This still leaves a lot of potential contents to be covered, including not only modeling algorithms, but also techniques for evaluating the quality of predictivemodels, transforming data tomake modeling algorithms easier to apply ormore likely to succeed, selecting attributes most useful for model creation, and combining multiple models for better predictions. Themodeling view of datamining is by nomeans unique for this book. It is actually themost natural and probably the most wide-spread view of data mining. Nevertheless, it deserves some more attention in this introductory discussion, which is supposed to let the reader know what this book is about. In particular, it is essential to underline – and it will be repeat- edly underlined on several other occasions throughout the book – that a useful data mining model is not merely a description of some patterns discovered in the data. In other words, it does not only and not mainly represent knowledge about the data, but also – and much more importantly – knowledge about the domain from which the data originates. The domain can be considered a set of entities from the realworld about which knowledge is supposed to be delivered by datamining. These can be people (such as customers, employ- ees, patients),machines and devices (such as car engines, computers, or ATMs), events (such as car failures, purchases, or bank transactions), industrial processes (such as manufactur- ing electronic components, energy production, or natural resources exploitation), business units (such as stores or corporate departments), to name only a few typical possibilities. Such real-world entities – in this book referred to as instances – are, usually incompletely and imperfectly, described by a set of features – in this book referred to as attributes.A dataset is a subset of the domain, described by the set of available attributes, usually – assuming a tabular data representation – with rows corresponding to instances and columns corresponding to attributes. Datamining can then be viewed as an analytic process that uses one or more avail- able datasets from the same domain to create one or more models for the domain, i.e., models that can be used to answer queries not just about instances from the data used for model cre- ation, but also about any other instances from the same domain. More directly and technically, speaking, if some attributes are generally available (observable) and some attributes are only available on a limited dataset (hidden), then models can often be viewed as delivering predic- tions of hidden attributes wherever their true values are unavailable. The unavailable attribute values to be predicted usually represent properties or quantities that are hard and costly to determine, or (more typically) that become known later than are needed. The latter justifies the term “prediction” used when referring to a model's output. The attribute to be predicted is referred to as the target attribute, and the observable attributes that can be used for prediction are referred to as the input attributes.},

abstract = {Cyber scanning refers to the task of probing enterprise networks or Internet wide services, searching for vulnerabilities or ways to infiltrate IT assets. This misdemeanor is often the primarily methodology that is adopted by attackers prior to launching a targeted cyber attack. Hence, it is of paramount importance to research and adopt methods for the detection and attribution of cyber scanning. Nevertheless, with the surge of complex offered services from one side and the proliferation of hackers' refined, advanced, and sophisticated techniques from the other side, the task of containing cyber scanning poses serious issues and challenges. Furthermore recently, there has been a flourishing of a cyber phenomenon dubbed as cyber scanning campaigns - scanning techniques that are highly distributed, possess composite stealth capabilities and high coordination - rendering almost all current detection techniques unfeasible. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the entire cyber scanning topic. It categorizes cyber scanning by elaborating on its nature, strategies and approaches. It also provides the reader with a classification and an exhaustive review of its techniques. Moreover, it offers a taxonomy of the current literature by focusing on distributed cyber scanning detection methods. To tackle cyber scanning campaigns, this paper uniquely reports on the analysis of two recent cyber scanning incidents. Finally, several concluding remarks are discussed.},

abstract = {The recovery of digital evidence of crimes from storage media is an increasingly time consuming process as the capacity of the storage media is in a state of constant growth. It is also a difficult and complex task for the forensic investigator to analyse all of the locations in the storage media. These two factors, when combined, may result in a delay in bringing a case to court. The concept of this paper is to start the initial forensic analysis of the storage media in locations that are most likely to contain digital evidence, the Windows Registry. Consequently, the forensic analysis process and the recovery of digital evidence may take less time than would otherwise be required. In this paper, the Registry structure of Windows 7 is discussed together with several elements of information within the Registry of Windows 7 that may be valuable to a forensic investigator. These elements were categorized into five groups which are system, application, networks, attached devices and the history lists. We have discussed the values of identified elements to a forensic investigator. Also, a tool was implemented to perform the function of extracting these elements and presents them in usable form to a forensics investigator.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: City planning is a complex task and therefore needs to consider the interplay between multi-aspects of a city, for example, transport, pollution, and crime. A city model is important to representing urban issues in a clear manner to the relative stakeholders. Although some city models have been used in the planning process, they are often based on narrow data sets. When sustainability and the quality of urban life generally is considered a more holistic analysis of city issues during the planning process is needed. It calls for city models to be based on integrated data sets. The paper describes the concept and challenges of nD urban information model. The research work on how to develop an nD urban information model to accommodate data sets relevant to different aspects of city planning is presented.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

After his initial exposure to Python as the built-in scripting language of Blender, the popular 3D modeling and rendering suite, the language became his tool of choice for many projects. He lives happily in a small converted farm, with his partner, three cats, and twelve goats.

abstract = {Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

abstract = {For computer software, our security models, poli- cies, mechanisms, and means of assurance were primarily con- ceived and developed before the end of the 1970's. However, since that time, software has changed radically: it is thousands of times larger, comprises countless libraries, layers, and services, and is used for more purposes, in far more complex ways. It is worthwhile to revisit our core computer security concepts. For example, it is unclear whether the Principle of Least Privilege can help dictate security policy, when software is too complex for either its developers or its users to explain its intended behavior. One possibility is to take an empirical, data-driven approach to modern software, and determine its exact, concrete behavior via comprehensive, online monitoring. Such an approach can be a practical, effective basis for security—as demonstrated by its success in spam and abuse fighting—but its use to constrain software behavior raises many questions. In particular, three questions seem critical. First, can we efficiently monitor the details of how software is behaving, in the large? Second, is it possible learn those details without intruding on users' privacy? Third, are those details a good foundation for security policies that constrain how software should behave? This paper outlines what a data-driven model for software security could look like, and describes how the above three questions can be answered affirmatively. Specifically, this paper briefly describes methods for efficient, detailed software monitor- ing, as well as methods for learning detailed software statistics while providing differential privacy for its users, and, finally, how machine learning methods can help discover users' expectations for intended software behavior, and thereby help set security policy. Those methods can be adopted in practice, even at very large scales, and demonstrate that data-driven software security models can provide real-world benefits.},

abstract = {—Access control is an extremely important and error-prone practice during web application. The emergence of NoSQL databases and the flexible data models they bring impose new challenges on the implementation of access control within web applications. This paper presents Scout, a novel methodology for discovering access control vulnerabilities in existing web applications. Meanwhile (1) features of NoSQL database can be addressed and (2) neither application source code nor server-side session information from the developers is required. This paper implements a prototype of Scout, which targets MongoDB backend web applications. By automatically discov-ering the protocol layer in the web application stack, Scout introduces a data access operation model precisely representing the MongoDB actions performed in the web application, as well as inferring the access control policies. The prototype is shown to be able to identify comprehensive access control vulnerabilities in MongoDB backend web applications, and generate detailed report as the facilitator to manually fix the identified vulnerabilities.},

abstract = {Blockchain is a decentralized transaction and data management technology developed first for Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The interest in Blockchain technology has been increasing since the idea was coined in 2008. The reason for the interest in Blockchain is its central attributes that provide security, anonymity and data integrity without any third party organization in control of the transactions, and therefore it creates interesting research areas, especially from the perspective of technical challenges and limitations. In this research, we have conducted a systematic mapping study with the goal of collecting all relevant research on Blockchain technology. Our objective is to understand the current research topics, challenges and future directions regarding Blockchain technology from the technical perspective. We have extracted 41 primary papers from scientific databases. The results show that focus in over 80{\%} of the papers is on Bitcoin system and less than 20{\%} deals with other Blockchain applications including e.g. smart contracts and licensing. The majority of research is focusing on revealing and improving limitations of Blockchain from privacy and security perspectives, but many of the proposed solutions lack concrete evaluation on their effectiveness. Many other Blockchain scalability related challenges including throughput and latency have been left unstudied. On the basis of this study, recommendations on future research directions are provided for researchers. {\textcopyright} 2016 Yli-Huumo et al.

abstract = {Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.},

Perhaps you already know a bit about machine learning, but have never used R; or perhaps you know a little R but are new to machine learning. In either case, this book will get you up and running quickly. It would be helpful to have a bit of familiarity with basic programming concepts, but no prior experience is required.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This has lead to novel approaches for scalable data management subsumed under the term “NoSQL” database systems to handle the ever-increasing data volume and request loads. However, the heterogeneity and diversity of the numerous existing systems impede the well-informed selection of a data store appropriate for a given application context. Therefore, this article gives a top-down overview of the field: instead of contrasting the implementation specifics of individual representatives, we propose a comparative classification model that relates functional and non-functional requirements to techniques and algorithms employed in NoSQL databases.

@article{Boneh2015,
abstract = {Preface Cryptography is an indispensable tool used to protect information in computing systems. It is used everywhere and by billions of people worldwide on a daily basis. It is used to protect data at rest and data in motion. Cryptographic systems are an integral part of standard protocols, most notably the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, making it relatively easy to incorporate strong encryption into a wide range of applications. While extremely useful, cryptography is also highly brittle. The most secure cryptographic system can be rendered completely insecure by a single specification or programming error. No amount of unit testing will uncover a security vulnerability in a cryptosystem. Instead, to argue that a cryptosystem is secure, we rely on mathematical modeling and proofs to show that a particular system satisfies the security properties attributed to it. We often need to introduce certain plausible assumptions to push our security arguments through. This book is about exactly that: constructing practical cryptosystems for which we can argue security under plausible assumptions. The book covers many constructions for di↵erent tasks in cryptography. For each task we define a precise security goal that we aim to achieve and then present constructions that achieve the required goal. To analyze the constructions, we develop a unified framework for doing cryptographic proofs. A reader who masters this framework will be capable of applying it to new constructions that may not be covered in the book. Throughout the book we present many case studies to survey how deployed systems operate. We describe common mistakes to avoid as well as attacks on real-world systems that illustrate the importance of rigor in cryptography. We end every chapter with a fun application that applies the ideas in the chapter in some unexpected way. Intended audience and how to use this book The book is intended to be self contained. Some supplementary material covering basic facts from probability theory and algebra is provided in the appendices. The book is divided into three parts. The first part develops symmetric encryption which explains how two parties, Alice and Bob, can securely exchange information when they have a shared key unknown to the attacker. The second part develops the concepts of public-key encryption and digital signatures, which allows Alice and Bob to do the same, but without having a shared, secret key. The third part is about cryptographic protocols, such as protocols for user identification, key exchange, and secure computation. A beginning reader can read though the book to learn how cryptographic systems work and why they are secure. Every security theorem in the book is followed by a proof idea that explains at a high level why the scheme is secure. On a first read one can skip over the detailed proofs 2},

abstract = {Cloud computing is a rapidly evolving information technology (IT) phenomenon. Rather than procure, deploy and manage a physical IT infrastructure to host their software applications, organizations are increasingly deploying their infrastructure into remote, virtualized environments, often hosted and managed by third parties. This development has significant implications for digital forensic investigators, equipment vendors, law enforcement, as well as corporate compliance and audit departments (among others). Much of digital forensic practice assumes careful control and management of IT assets (particularly data storage) during the conduct of an investigation. This paper summarises the key aspects of cloud computing and analyses how established digital forensic procedures will be invalidated in this new environment. Several new research challenges addressing this changing context are also identified and discussed.},

abstract = {Objective. To determine whether breastfeeding reduced the risk of childhood obesity in the infants of a multi-ethnic cohort of women with pregestational diabetes. Methods. In this retrospective cohort study, women with pregestational diabetes were mailed a questionnaire about breastfeeding and current height and weight of mothers and infants. Predictors of obesity (weight for age {\textgreater}85 percentile) were assessed among offspring of index pregnancies, using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Results. Of 125 women, 81 (65{\%}) had type 1 diabetes and 44 (35{\%}) had type 2 diabetes. The mean age of offspring was 4.5 years. On univariate analysis, significant predictors of obesity in offspring were type 2 diabetes (odds ratio, OR 2.4, 95{\%} confidence interval, CI 0.99-5.72); maternal body mass index (BMI) {\textgreater} 25 (OR 4.4, 95{\%} CI 1.4-19.4); and any breastfeeding (OR 0.22, 95{\%} CI 0.07-0.72). After multivariable adjustment, breastfeeding (OR 0.20, 95{\%} CI 0.06-0.69) and having an overweight/obese mother (OR 3.49, 95{\%} CI 1.03-16.2) remained independently associated with childhood obesity. Conclusion. Breastfeeding significantly decreased the likelihood of obesity in offspring of mothers with pregestational diabetes, independent of maternal BMI and diabetes type. Women with diabetes should be encouraged to breastfeed, given the increased risk of obesity in their children.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Many organizations collect vast amounts of customer, scientific, sales, and other data for future analysis. Traditionally, most of these organizations have stored structured data in relational databases for subsequent access and analysis. However, a growing number of developers and users have begun turning to various types of nonrelational, now frequently called NoSQL-databases. Nonrelational databases, including hierarchical, graph, and object-oriented databases-have been around since the late 1960s. However, new types of NoSQL databases are being developed. And only now are they beginning to gain market traction. Different NoSQL databases take different approaches. What they have in common is that they're not relational. Their primary advantage is that, unlike relational databases, they handle unstructured data such as word-processing files, e-mail, multimedia, and social media efficiently. This paper discuss issues such as limitations, advantages, concerns and doubts regarding NoSQL databases.},

abstract = {Rogue behaviors refer to behavioral anomalies that can occur in human activities and that can thus be retrieved from human generated data. In this paper, we aim at showing that NoSQL graph databases are a useful tool for this purpose. Indeed these database engines exploit property graphs that can easily represent human and object interactions whatever the volume and complexity of the data. These interactions lead to fraud rings in the graphs in the form of sophisticated chains of indirect links between fraudsters representing successive transactions (money, communications, etc.) from which rogue behaviours are detected. Our work is based on two extensions of such NoSQL graph databases. The first extension allows the handling of time-variant data while the second one is devoted to the management of imprecise queries with a DSL (to define flexible operators and operations with Scala) and the Cypherf declarative flexible query language over NoSQL graph databases. These extensions allow to better address and describe sophisticated frauds. Feasibility have been studied to assess our proposition.},

abstract = {The third edition contains a number of new chapters, and various material has been moved around. • The chapter on Stream Ciphers has been split into two. One chapter now deals with the general background and historical matters, the second chapter deals with modern constructions based on LFSR's. The reason for this is to accomodate a major new section on the Lorenz cipher and how it was broken. This compliments the earlier section on the breaking of the Enigma machine. I have also added a brief discussion of the A5/1 cipher, and added some more diagrams to the discussion on modern stream ciphers. • I have added CTR mode into the discussion on modes of operation for block ciphers. This is because CTR mode is becoming more used, both by itself and as part of more complex modes which perform full authenticated encryption. Thus it is important that students are exposed to this mode. • I have reordered various chapters and introduced a new part on protocols, in which we cover secret sharing, oblvious transfer and multi-party computation. This compliments the topics from the previous edition of commitment schemes and zero-knowledge protocols, which are retained a moved around a bit. Thus the second edition's Part 3 has now been split into two parts, the material on zero-knowledge proofs has now been moved to Part 5 and this has been extended to include other topics, such as oblivious transfer and secure multi-party computation. • The new chapter on secret sharing contains a complete description of how to recombine shares in the Shamir secret-sharing method in the presence of malicious adversaries. To our knowledge this is not presented in any other elementary textbook, although it does occur in some lecture notes available on the internet. We also present an overview of Shoup's method for obtaining threshold RSA signatures. • A small section detailing the linkage between zero-knowledge and the complexity class N P has been added. The reason for including extra sections etc, is that we use this text in our courses at Bristol, and so when we update our lecture notes I also update these notes. In addition at various points students do projects with us, a number of recent projects have been on multi-party computation and hence these students have found a set of notes useful in starting their projects. We have also introduced a history of computing unit in which I give a few lectures on the work at Bletchley. Special thanks for aspects of the third edition go to Dan Bernstein and Ivan Damg{\aa}rd, who were patient in explaining a number of issues to me for inclusion in the new sections. Also thanks to},

Digital forensic is the procedure of investigating computer crimes in the cyber world. Many researches have been done in this area to help forensic investigation to resolve existing challenges. This paper attempts to look into trends of applications of digital forensics and security at hand in various aspects and provide some estimations about future research trends in this area.},

abstract = {The premise of this book, and the other books in the Think X series, is that if you know how to program, you can use that skill to learn other topics. Most books on Bayesian statistics use mathematical notation and present ideas in terms of mathematical concepts like calculus. This book uses Python code instead of math, and discrete approximations instead of con- tinuous mathematics. As a result, what would be an integral in a math book becomes a summation, and most operations on probability distributions are simple loops.},

abstract = {R is a powerful language and environment for sta- tistical computing and graphics. It is a public do- main (a so called “GNU”) project which is similar to the commercial S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (for- merly AT{\&}T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S, and is much used in as an educational language and research tool. The main advantages of R are the fact that R is freeware and that there is a lot of help available online. It is quite similar to other programming packages such as MatLab (not freeware), but more user-friendly than programming languages such as C++ or Fortran. You can use R as it is, but for educational purposes we prefer to use R in combi- nation with the RStudio interface (also freeware), which has an organized layout and several extra options. This document contains explanations, exam- ples and exercises, which can also be understood (hopefully) by people without any programming experience. Going through all text and exercises takes about 1 or 2 hours. Examples of frequently used commands and error messages are listed on the last two pages of this document and can be used as a reference while programming.},

abstract = {Big data implies performing computation and database operations for massive amounts of data, remotely from the data owner's enterprise. Since a key value proposition of big data is access to data from multiple and diverse domains, security and privacy will play a very important role in big data research and technology. The limitations of standard IT security practices are well-known, making the ability of attackers to use software subversion to insert malicious software into applications and operating systems a serious and growing threat whose adverse impact is intensified by big data. So, a big question is what security and privacy technology is adequate for controlled assured sharing for efficient direct access to big data. Making effective use of big data requires access from any domain to data in that domain, or any other domain it is authorized to access. Several decades of trusted systems developments have produced a rich set of proven concepts for verifiable protection to substantially cope with determined adversaries, but this technology has largely been marginalized as “overkill” and vendors do not widely offer it. This talk will discuss pivotal choices for big data to leverage this mature security and privacy technology, while identifying remaining research challenges.},

@book{Soediono1989,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},
